# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Complete main Telegram onboarding before any plugin setup; the installed agent
  owns plugin preparation and QR onboarding in the owner's Telegram conversation.
- Add host preflight, installation status and artifact-specific build diagnostics.
- Preserve the built relay image in each deployment and reject duplicate builds.

## 0.1.0-beta.2 — npm distribution

- Publish under `@jc_stack/ez-agents`; GitHub remains `jdorado/ez-agents`.
- Document pinned npm downloads and retain the beta-only distribution channel.
- Runtime behavior and dependencies are unchanged from beta.1. Live account and
  reboot acceptance remain deferred.

## 0.1.0-beta.1 — initial public beta

- Owner-paired Telegram relay using an existing host AI CLI and persistent
  Markdown workspace, with queued execution and explicit messaging tools.
- Docker runtime, private deployment creation and a local hash-pinned plugin
  manager with explicit installation/start/stop and provider-owned onboarding.
- Empty default catalog: no unpublished sibling package required.
- Public contribution, security, packaging and release instructions.

Limits: trusted host administration, not hostile-agent isolation. No hosted
service or remote plugin marketplace. Desktop executor acceptance and optional
voice providers need separate verification; CLI success is not GUI evidence.

Beta acceptance: automated tests, packed installs and Docker fixtures only. Live
provider onboarding and reboot verification are deferred, not marked passed.
